# CS-370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?


The objective of this project was to create a section of code that allows the intelligent agent to find the optimal path to the treasure using deep Q-learning. I was provided with two py files, one that represents the environment and one that stores the episodes. In Jupyter Notebook, I was given code that established the maze, the movement options of the agent, a function that simulates a full game based on the trained model, a function to determine whether the pirate can win any game at all based on the maze, and a built neural network model. The code I created myself implemented deep Q-learning to find the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward. 


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?


Computer scientists drive technological innovation by developing new algorithms, technologies, and systems that improve efficiency, enhance productivity, and enable new capabilities. As a computer scientist, I approach a problem by thoroughly understanding the issue and breaking it down into smaller components to select a solution that is efficient and effective. My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization include maintaining user privacy and data protection, transparency, and inclusivity. It is crucial to ensure users are aware of how their data is being used and that their data is handled securely.  It is also my responsibility to ensure I do not violate ethical principles, cause harm, or infringe on human rights.
